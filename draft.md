## R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS).

+ The `method` argument of `sort.list()`, `order()` and `sort.int()` gains an `"auto"` option (the default) which should behave the same as before when `method` was left missing.

+ The `plot` method for `ppr` has enhanced default labels (xmin and main).

+ `sample.int()` gains an explicit `useHash` option (with a back compatible default).

+ `addNA()` is faster now, e.g., when applied twice. (Part of PR#16895.)

+ Illegal factors, e.g., with duplicated levels (illegal but constructable) now give a warning when printed, via new function `.valid.factor()`.

+ `sessionInfo()` has been updated for Apple's change in OS naming as from `10.12` (`macOS Sierra` _vs_ `OS X El Capitan`).

+ Its `toLatex()` method now includes the `running` component.

+ `options("interrupt")` can be used to specify a default action for user interrupts. For now, if this option is not set and the `error` option is set, then an unhandled user interrupt invokes the `error` option. This may be dropped in the future as `interrupt` conditions are not `error` conditions.

+ Radix sort is now the default algorithm for double vectors. It no longer rounds.

+ `stack.data.frame` and `stack.default` preserve the names of empty elements in the levels of the `ind` column of the return value. Set the new `drop` argument to `TRUE` for the previous behavior.
