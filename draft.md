###  Quotes of the Week

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Favorite <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rmarkdown?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rmarkdown</a> trick Iâ€™ve learned recently: in your chunk options, eval does not have to equal just TRUE or FALSE. You can set it to a Boolean variable of your own creation, meaning chunks can be evaluated on a conditional basis, depending on whatâ€™s in your data ðŸŽ‰</p>&mdash; Meghan Hall (@MeghanMHall) <a href="https://twitter.com/MeghanMHall/status/1448663277802692624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
